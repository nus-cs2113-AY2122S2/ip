## Quick Start
1. Ensure that you have `Java 11` or above installed on your computer.
2. Download the latest release of `Warren's version of Duke` from Github [here](https://github.com/warrencxw/ip/releases).
3. Copy the file to a folder that you want to use as the _home folder_ for the application.
   Do note that a new folder `data` would be created in the same folder,
   along with the save file `save.csv` within that folder, to save all your tasks.
4. Open your command line interface or terminal _(e.g. `cmd`)_ and change the working directory to the _home folder_.
5. Run the program by using the command `java -jar ip.jar`. An interface similar to the one below should appear.
