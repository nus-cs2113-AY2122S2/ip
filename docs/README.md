## File storage information
When EM is run for the first time, a directory and a file would be created to store all the task information.
"database/database.txt" will be created in the same directory as where ip.jar file is being saved. 

On subsequent run of EM, the data stored in database.txt will be loaded into the program. EM's list will store 
tasks information of previous session as well as the current session. 


### Caution

During the booting of EM, the database file wil be loaded. If modifications have been 
made to the file and is in invalid format, EM will fail to load the data into the program.
As a result, you would have to delete the compromised file.
