## Setting up in Intellij

Prerequisites: JDK 11, update Intellij to the most recent version.

1. Open Intellij (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project first)
2. Open the project into Intellij as follows:
    1. Click `Open`.
    2. Select the project directory, and click `OK`.
    3. If there are any further prompts, accept the defaults.
3. Configure the project to use **JDK 11** (not other versions) as explained in [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk).<br>
   In the same dialog, set the **Project language level** field to the `SDK default` option.
4. After that, locate the `src/main/java/Baymax.java` file, right-click it, and choose `Run Baymax.main()` (if the code editor is showing compile errors, try restarting the IDE). If the setup is correct, you should see something like the below as the output:

```
Hello, I'm Baymax.
Your personal task managing companion. 
What can I do for you? 
```

5. The application now should run in the console.
6. Now you can interact with the program in the console.

3. `cd` into the project's `out\production\ip` directory
4. Type `java Baymax`, then press enter to execute.
