 Hello! I'm Duke
 What can I do for you?

 An event! Perhaps it can distract you from your self-inflicted prison:
   [E][ ] some birthday party (at: Saturday 3pm)
 There are now 1 tasks in the list.

 Do these tasks distract you from a glaring lack of meaning
  in your life?
Anyway, I added it to the list.
   [T][ ] see gardens by the bay
 There are now 2 tasks in the list.

 Great, something else for you to procrastinate:
   [D][ ] do homework (by: Monday)
 There are now 3 tasks in the list.
