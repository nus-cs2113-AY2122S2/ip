Do you understand this?
Of course, you cannot understand this.
Because I didn't program you.
But you will understand those.
Now I will add multiple tasks
add "multiple task1   " multiple_task2 "    multiple task3" "multiple    task4"
Now I will finish task 1 and 4
mark 1 4
Now I will try to finish task5, which is not created.
mark 5
Now show me all the tasks.
list
I lied to you, I didn't finish task4, so unmark
unmark 4
Show me all the tasks again
list
Now I will add multiple todoes
todo "   multiple todo1" multiple_todo2 "    multiple todo3" "multiple       todo4"
list
Now I will add multiple deadlines
deadline "  ddl  1 " "d d l 2" ddl3 /by "time for ddl1,2,3" "d d l 4" ddl5 ddl6 /by timefor4,5,6
list
Now I will add multiple events
event "event1" event2 "  ev ent  3  " /at "duration for event 1, 2, 3" event4 event5 "ddl6" /at duration_for_event_4,5,6
Now I will mark and unmark random tasks/todoes/ddls/events
mark 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29
list
unmark 3 8 9 10 21 25 27 29
